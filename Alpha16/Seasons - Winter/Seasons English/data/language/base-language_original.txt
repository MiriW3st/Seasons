campaignchapter_deathrow                Death Row

campaignchapter_deathrow_description    We've been contracted to build an Execution Chamber at this prison, in time for the scheduled execution of one of their in-mates.

campaigncutscene_deathrowmurder         Double Murder
campaigncutscene_deathrowconfession     Confession

adviser_deathrow_murder1                I knew I'd catch you two here.
adviser_deathrow_murder2                Edward! I...
adviser_deathrow_murder25               Don't.  Just....Don't.
adviser_deathrow_murder3                What are you going to do?

adviser_deathrow_church1                Can I help you?
adviser_deathrow_church15               ...
adviser_deathrow_church2                Are you looking for forgiveness?
adviser_deathrow_church3                I don't know. I have to do something, I can't live with the things I've done.
adviser_deathrow_church4                You have to turn yourself in. Whatever you've done, you cannot evade the consequences. 
adviser_deathrow_church5                You will never be able to live with yourself until you face up to your past.
adviser_deathrow_church6                I want to go back. I want to forgive her. I want her to forgive me.
adviser_deathrow_church7                God will forgive you, no matter what you have done, if you ask him to. 
adviser_deathrow_church8                But you must answer for your crimes in the eyes of the law.  There is no other way.

adviser_deathrowintro_1                 This is a tough one.
adviser_deathrowintro_2                 There's a prisoner incarcerated at this facility who's been convicted of a double murder, and sentenced to death.  
adviser_deathrowintro_3                 That's where we come in.  We've been contracted to construct an execution chamber in time for the guys big day.
adviser_deathrowintrob_1                This is where I want the new facility to be built.
adviser_deathrowintrob_2                The first step with any project like this is to construct the building itself - with enough space inside to fit an execution room and a holding cell.
adviser_deathrowintrob_3                So let's get started.  Construct a new building here.

adviser_deathrow_explain1               Your Workmen are responsible for construction of buildings.
adviser_deathrow_explain2               They'll collect the Steel and concrete from this store room and take it to the construction site.
adviser_deathrow_explain3               They'll use those raw materials to build the foundations and framework of your new building.
adviser_deathrow_explain4               This is the slowest part of construction, so you should plan ahead when building new facilities.
adviser_deathrow_explain5               While we wait, take a look around.  Use WASD or the arrow keys to move around, and use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

objective_deathrow_building             Construct a building to house the Execution Facility

adviser_deathrow_buildinside1           We will also need an entrance to the new Execution Facility.
adviser_deathrow_buildinside2           Build a Large Jail Door into the south wall.

objective_deathrow_buildouterdoor       Build a Large Jail Door entrance

adviser_deathrow_internalwalls1          Inside the building I want a Jail Cell and an Execution Room.
adviser_deathrow_internalwalls2          Partition the space by constructing some Brick Walls.

objective_deathrow_buildinternalwalls   Build internal walls

adviser_deathrow_internaldoors1          Now add Large Jail Doors to those dividing walls.
adviser_deathrow_internaldoors2          You can rotate an object before placement by clicking the middle mouse button (or press R).

objective_deathrow_buildinternaldoors   Build internal doors (Middle Click or press R to rotate an object)

adviser_deathrow_designation1           That's looking good.  We now need to Designate Rooms within those spaces.
adviser_deathrow_designation2           Designate a Cell in the smaller area where our condemned inmate will live.
adviser_deathrow_designation3           Then designate the Execution Room itself in the larger area.

objective_deathrow_designatecell        Designate a Cell
objective_deathrow_designateexecution   Designate an Execution Room

adviser_deathrow_roomrequirements1      Those new Rooms have requirements before they become functional.  
adviser_deathrow_roomrequirements2      The Cell needs a Bed and a Toilet.
adviser_deathrow_roomrequirements3      The Execution Room requires the Electric Chair.

objective_deathrow_cellobjects1         Build a Bed
objective_deathrow_cellobjects2         Build a Toilet
objective_deathrow_executionobjects     Build an Electric Chair

adviser_deathrow_optional1              That's the essentials taken care of.  But there are still a few improvements you could make.
adviser_deathrow_optional2              It's up to you though, these aren't strictly required.  It depends how much you care about your prisoners and their environment.
adviser_deathrow_optional3              The Cell itself could be improved with an outward facing Window, and a small Bookshelf.  
adviser_deathrow_optional4              And the facility would look better with a higher quality floor material - like Wooden Floorboards or Mosaic Tiles.
adviser_deathrow_optional5              Outside you could add some lighting, and a paved pathway if you think it needs it.

adviser_deathrow_transfer05             This is the man in question, Edward Romsey.  A teacher once, would you believe.
adviser_deathrow_transfer06             It's not our place to decide if he deserves this.  The Law has made that decision.  We're just here to do a job.
adviser_deathrow_transfer1              Once you are satisfied the facility is ready, you can begin the Prisoner Transfer to his new cell.
adviser_deathrow_transfer2              Simply click on him to select him, then Right Click just outside his Cell to initiate the transfer.

objective_deathrow_path                 (OPTIONAL) Build a Path to the new facility
objective_deathrow_window               (OPTIONAL) Add a Window to the Cell
objective_deathrow_bookshelf            (OPTIONAL) Add a bookshelf to the Cell
objective_deathrow_flooring             (OPTIONAL) Redo the flooring with higher quality materials
objective_deathrow_outerlights          (OPTIONAL) Create some outdoor lighting around the facility
objective_deathrow_transferinmate       When you are done, begin the Prisoner Transfer.  Click to select him, then Right Click in the zone outside his cell.

adviser_deathrow_setupmurder1           Don't shed one tear for this guy.  He's a stone cold killer, guilty as charged. 
adviser_deathrow_setupmurder2           He even confessed.  Wanna hear his description of what he did?  
adviser_deathrow_setupmurder3           It's juicy stuff.  "It was around 11pm.  The lights were already on.  I knew she was home..."
adviser_deathrow_postmurder1            Like I said, a stone cold killer.
adviser_deathrow_postmurder2            Clear as day if you ask me.  Deserves every volt he's gonna get.
adviser_deathrow_postmurder3            All men deserve forgiveness, even him. Are you so sure in yourself that you can deal out such final judgement?
adviser_deathrow_postmurder4            Catching your wife with another man is no excuse for what he did. 
adviser_deathrow_postmurder5            And he went there with a loaded gun, knowing he'd find them together. That's double pre-meditated murder.
adviser_deathrow_postmurder6            He's done nothing but co-operate with the authorities. This state is making an example of him. 
adviser_deathrow_postmurder7            If he'd committed his crime 100 miles north he'd be looking at life imprisonment instead. How is that justice?
adviser_deathrow_postmurder8            Do you want a guy like this running free? I'll sleep just fine at night when I know he's gone.
           

adviser_deathrowelectricity_1           Good work so far.
adviser_deathrowelectricity_2           However there is one problem - the execution room isn't functioning yet, because it doesn't have any power.
adviser_deathrowelectricity_3           We need to connect it to the electricity supply.

adviser_deathrowelectricityb_1          We are now viewing the prison in Utilities mode, which shows us the electrical wiring layout for the entire prison. 
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_2          Each building in the prison is connected to the Power Grid by these thick underground electrical cables.  
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_3          Power is provided to the prison by this substation, which draws electricity from the national grid.
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_4          As you can see, this entire wing of prison cells is without power.  All of the lights are out.
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_4b         To fix this problem, we first need to switch into Utilities mode to understand why the lights are without power.
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_5          The nearest electrical cables are too far away - our engineers can't complete the wiring for this area.
adviser_deathrowelectricityb_6          Extend the electrical cables nearby to cover this wing of the prison.

objective_deathrow_cellpower            Connect room to Electrical Supply

adviser_deathrow_connectchair_1         Lights aren't the only thing that needs power.  Your new Electric Chair does too.
adviser_deathrow_connectchair_2         Use the Power Cables to connect the execution facility to the power grid.
adviser_deathrow_connectchair_3         The Electric Chair itself is a special type of electrical item.  It requires its own dedicated power line. You'll need to connect it up directly with mains cables.

objective_deathrow_chairpower           Connect Electric Chair to Electrical Supply
objective_deathrow_condemnedcellpower   Connect Jail Cell to Electrical Supply

adviser_deathrow_testchair_1            We are almost done I think.  We should test the new Execution room at least once before we try to use it though.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_2            I'm just going to turn it on for a few seconds, make sure everything is ok.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_3            Well, that didn't work.  Looks like we drew too much power, and tripped a circuit breaker in the power station.  The whole prison is dark.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_4            We're going to need more juice to be able to handle the power spike that the electric chair generates.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_5            First, we need to turn the power back on.   This is a two step process:
adviser_deathrow_testchair_5b           Step one, switch each Capacitor back on by clicking on them in Utilities Mode.  Step two, Switch the power station back on by clicking on it.  
adviser_deathrow_testchair_6            Then build three more capacitors so we have enough Power Capacity to handle the electric chair.
adviser_deathrow_testchair_7            Once you've done that, test the Electric chair again by clicking on it in Utilities Mode to turn it on.

objective_deathrow_poweron              Turn the Power Station back on. (In Utilities Mode, click on each Capacitor, then click on the Power Station to restart it)
objective_deathrow_expandpower          Expand the power station with three new Capacitors
objective_deathrow_chairworking         Test the chair again (click on it in Utilities Mode to turn it on)

adviser_deathrow_execution_1            Well done.  I believe we are finished with this job.
adviser_deathrow_execution_2            What happens now is out of our hands.  We did a professional job, and that's important in our business.
adviser_deathrow_execution_3            Try not to worry about what happens next.  

adviser_deathrow_setupexecution1        It is time Edward. 
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution2        You have done the right thing, even though this world will not forgive you for it.
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution3        You will be with God soon, and He will have the final judgement on you.

adviser_deathrow_setupexecution4        Edward Romsey.  You have been found guilty of two counts of murder in the first degree.
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution5        The penalty is death.  
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution6        Do you have anything to say?
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution7        Susan...
adviser_deathrow_setupexecution8        I'm sorry.
